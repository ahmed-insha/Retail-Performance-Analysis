Analyzed customer behaviors, sales trends, and product preferences using Excel, SQL, and Power BI, providing actionable insights and strategic recommendations to boost targeted marketing, retention, and cost efficiency.

### Project Overview
The goal of this project is to analyze and optimize retail performance for a leading retail chain in India. By utilizing SQL, Excel, and Power BI, we analyzed customer behaviors, sales patterns, and product preferences, providing actionable insights for targeted marketing, customer retention, and cost optimization. Our analysis supports the clientâ€™s CRM, marketing, and sales strategies.

### Business Context
The client is one of the leading retail chains in India and partnered with Analytixlabs for data-driven insights from point-of-sale data. The objective was to measure, manage, and analyze business performance across categories, customers, stores, channels, and sales.

Data provided includes transactions for selected categories, specific customer purchases, and store-level information.
#### Data Cleaning and Preparation:
Imported data into SQL Server for further processing.
Cleaned and pre-processed data for consistency and accuracy (handling missing values, duplicates, and correcting data type inconsistencies).
Created three primary tables for analysis: Customer Level, Order Level, and Store Level.
#### Key Responsibilities:
Conducted exploratory data analysis to generate key metrics such as order counts, average discounts, average order value, and repeat purchase rates.
Performed customer segmentation based on revenue and Recency, Frequency, Monetary (RFM) metrics.
Analyzed sales trends, seasonality, and category performance by store, region, and channel.
Generated insights into product cross-selling opportunities and customer preferences.

#### Tools Used:
SQL for data extraction and cleaning.
Excel for exploratory analysis and basic visualizations.
